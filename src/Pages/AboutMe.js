            <p>I'm a Junior Web Developer. I complete my web development course at Programming Hero. Whatever I'm continuing my BSC at Ranada Prasad Shaha University on Computer Science and Engineering.</p>
            <br />
            <p>Since childhood, I always want to be a Computer Engineer. And now I decided to be a Web Developer, because making a website is a lot of fun for me. When I see new features on different websites, I also try those features. I try to keep myself updated all the time.</p>
            <br />
            <p>I have mastered HTML, CSS, JavaScript, but I still have a lot to learn. I worked on CSS's framework like Bootstrap, Tailwind but I like Tailwind the most. I try to make a lot of small projects.</p>
